# Week06-assignment
Cookie Clicker game with React.js


Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.
(Required)
🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
    - I believe i've met all the requirements .
🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
    - Did not implement reset game button, ran out of time.
    -I did not achieve the last stretch goal to import upgrades.
🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
    - Got carried away for majority of the time trying to create a much bigger game than the requirements are, realised I don't yet know enough to be able to implement other aspects to the game and forgot that I needed to add upgrades from an API.
(Optional)
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.
    - Made a big mistake of not focusing on the REQUIRED functionality first and only then try making the app better or add more things to it, could have finished it far sooner if I checked the assignment read-me much more often, to be sure I am on track and not working on things that are not part of the assignment requirements but are actually extra stretch goals.

What went really well and what could have gone better?
    - Functionality wise it went pretty well, but I clearly did not understand well enough how to use React components to seperate all my code better into components of the App.
